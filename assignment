Question 6 - Using the data from Question 3, write code to analyze the data and answer the following questions Note 
1.Draw plots to demonstrate the analysis for the following questions for better visualizations.
2. Write code comments wherever required for code understanding
#we wrote below code to extract data from link as guided by question 

import requests
import json

# Make an HTTP GET request to download the JSON file
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json'
response = requests.get(url)

# Load the JSON data
data = json.loads(response.text)

# Extract the desired data from the JSON structure
# Modify this section according to the specific data you want to extract
pokemon_list = data['pokemon']
for pokemon in pokemon_list:
    name = pokemon['name']
    types = pokemon['type']
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print(f"Types: {types}")
    print('---')

Insights to be drawn -
● Get all Pokemons whose spawn rate is less than 5%
pokemon_less_than_5_percent = [pokemon for pokemon in data['pokemon'] if pokemon['spawn_chance'] < 5]
for pokemon in pokemon_less_than_5_percent:
    name = pokemon['name']
    spawn_rate = pokemon['spawn_chance']
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print(f"Spawn Rate: {spawn_rate}")
    print('---')

● Get all Pokemons that have less than 4 weaknesses
pokemon_less_than_4_weaknesses = [pokemon for pokemon in data['pokemon'] if len(pokemon['weaknesses']) < 4]
for pokemon in pokemon_less_than_4_weaknesses:
    name = pokemon['name']
    weaknesses = pokemon['weaknesses']
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print(f"Weaknesses: {weaknesses}")
    print('---')
● Get all Pokemons that have no multipliers at all
pokemon_no_multipliers = [pokemon for pokemon in data['pokemon'] if not pokemon.get('multipliers')]
for pokemon in pokemon_no_multipliers:
    name = pokemon['name']
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print('---')
● Get all Pokemons that do not have more than 2 evolutions
pokemon_no_mowre_than_2_evolutions = [pokemon for pokemon in data['pokemon'] if len(pokemon.get('next_evolution', [])) <= 2]
for pokemon in pokemon_no_mowre_than_2_evolutions:
    name = pokemon['name']
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print('---')
● Get all Pokemons whose spawn time is less than 300 seconds.
pokemon_less_than_300_sec = [pokemon for pokemon in data['pokemon'] if pokemon['spawn_time'] < '300']
for pokemon in pokemon_less_than_300_sec:
    name = pokemon['name']
    spawn_time = pokemon['spawn_time']
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print(f"Spawn Time: {spawn_time}")
    print('---')
Note - spawn time format is "05:32”, so assume “minute: second” format and perform the analysis.
● Get all Pokemon who have more than two types of capabilities
pokemon_more_than_2_capabilities = [pokemon for pokemon in data['pokemon'] if len(pokemon['type']) > 2]
for pokemon in pokemon_more_than_2_capabilities:
    name = pokemon['name']
    capabilities = pokemon['type']
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print(f"Capabilities: {capabilities}")
    print('---')
